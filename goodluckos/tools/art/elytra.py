# The elytra and the firework rocket when the player has no Minecraft of their own: Pixel Perfection Legacy by Nova
# Wostra (CC BY-SA 4.0, https://modrinth.com/resourcepack/pixel-perfection-legacy, 26.3-97.2 unzipped), copied under
# goodluck_elytra's names, the rocket's sparks and smoke as strips of their frames. And the wings' mesh, Minecraft's
# ElytraModel on the body's top (10x20x2 each, 1 px bigger all round, 2 px behind the back), as goodluck_models'
# elytra.glb. Its animation holds the wings' poses as ElytraAnimationState sets them, frames in seconds: 0-1 spreading
# from folded (x 15, z -15 degrees) to the glide's (x 20, z -90), 1-2 folding back, 2-3 the crouch's (x 40, y 5,
# z -45, 3 px lower), 3-4 back
