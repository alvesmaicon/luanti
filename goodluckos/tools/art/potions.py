# The potions' and their ingredients' textures when the player has no Minecraft of their own: Pixel Perfection Legacy
# by Nova Wostra (CC BY-SA 4.0, 26.3-97.2 unzipped) for the items, and for the brewing stand, which it lacks, Pixel
# Perfection's as Mineclonia 0.124.0 carries them (mcl_brewing; its LEGAL.md), put together in Minecraft's own layout
# (its block model takes the arms from the halves of one texture, the rod from its middle); the brewing window's arrow
# and fuel bar are goodluckOS's own
